👋 Hi, I’m @ELAINNE1409
👀 I’m interested in software, nursing, healthy living, and dance.
🌱 I’m currently learning and reviewing my recent course in Software Quality Assurance from ISEP (Porto-Portugal).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with companies in the software sector (API, automated testing, Frontend React), ideally starting with an internship.
📫 How to reach me: elainnecristina.14@gmail.com
😄 Pronouns: she/her
⚡ Fun fact: I'm a trained nurse by profession and not a developer. Since watching the movie Matrix and Enemy of the State, I've been curious about technologies.
